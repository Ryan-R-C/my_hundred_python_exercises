# my_hundred_python_exercises
My first programming language, Python. Made in 2019.
These 111 exercises were made while I was studying python course from "Curso em VÃ­deo".
Since then I have evolved as not just a programmer but much more as a person.
Thinking critically I did not named the variables with good names and did not commented my files, but everything I have done is treated as a way to learn.
Hello, World!
